					Reactive Forms in Angular
					~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~			
-> Model driven Forms are also called as Reactive Forms. 

-> It is completely based on component logic.

-> In reactive forms you declare all of your fields and validation in component class  and then we can link-up with HTML template. 

-> We need to use FormGroup and FormControl class to prepare form fields.

-> We have more controlling on validation logic.

-> It is more comfortable for perform unit testing on validations. Test automation also easy with reactive forms.

Note:
-> We need to import ReactiveFormsModule in Application Module.

-> Classes Involved in component to define validations:
		1. FormGroup
		2. FormControl
		3. Validators		
-----------------------------------------------------------

Creating Forms in TS file:

  customerForm : FormGroup = new FormGroup({
    fname :  new FormControl('', Validators.required),
    lname :  new FormControl('', Validators.required),
    city :  new FormControl('',  [Validators.minLength(3), Validators.maxLength(10)]),
    email :  new FormControl('', Validators.email),
    pincode :  new FormControl('', Validators.pattern("\\d{6}")),
  });
