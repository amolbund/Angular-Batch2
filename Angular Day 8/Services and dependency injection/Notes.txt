Dependency Injection  and Services in Angular
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--> Dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform its function. 

--> Dependency injection, or DI, is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.

--> Angular's DI framework provides dependencies to a class upon instantiation. Use Angular DI to increase flexibility and modularity in your applications.



What is Service and Why it is required?


--> A Service is a class that provide common functionality which can be used by other programming items of Angular Application. (Eg:  Components, Service, Directive, etc...)

--> Service class are decorate with @Injectable()


Pre-defined Service in Angular
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  HttpClient
2.  ActivatedRoute
3.  Router
4.  ElementRef
5.  TemplateRef
6.   ViewContainerRef



How to create Services?

	ng g s db
	ng g s data
	ng g s user
	....
	
	
	>	File:		user.service.ts
	
	import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

	@Injectable({
	  providedIn: 'root'
	})
	export class UserService {

	  constructor() { }
	}




Note:

-->  The @Injectable() decorator specifies that Angular can use this class in the DI system. 


Service Injection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	constructor(private  serviceObj:ServiceClassName)
	{
				
	}
